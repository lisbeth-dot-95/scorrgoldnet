Description: This package includes an artificial single cell RNA-seq data set which does not contain sparsity. By modifying a bulk RNA-seq data set, a reference was generated which contains true zeros. This reference data set can be used as a source to generate artificially, sparse data sets, therefore introducing false zero entries and checking their percentage of sparsity.
