# scorrgoldnet
A package to provide a synthetic reference data set which is not afflicted by sparsity. 
Originating from a bulk RNA-seq data set, 4960 genes across 800 cells were generated simulating eight different cell types.
Thhis package includes two functions:

* **get_sparsity** : The percentage of zeros in data set
* **Plot_distribution** : Plot the distribution of log-transformed expression values
