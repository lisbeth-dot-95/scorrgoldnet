# Data generation

The initial data generation was taken from the [SCRABBLE](https://github.com/software-github/SCRABBLE_PAPER) package. <br>
Briefly a bulkd data set is manipulated to generate single-cell like data <br>

![Overview of data generation](/home/steinheu/Desktop/Downsampling_Bulk_figure.png){#id .class width=95% height=95%}


It does: <br>
- contain 4960 genes across 800 cells <br>
- contain solely true zeros <br>
- contain internal correlation structure <br>

# The package

```{r setup}
library(scorrgoldnet)
```

## Loading the reference data

You can load the reference data set.

```{r load_data}
data("sc_gold")
```

## Check the gold reference data set

Then we can go a little bit deeper and check how many zeros are actually contained in the reference data set using the **get_sparsity** function. <br>
```{r sparsity_gold_data}

get_sparsity(sc_gold)

```

It appears that `r get_sparsity(sc_gold)` % are there. <br>

Then you can plot the distribution of log-transformed expression values.


```{r analysis_gold_data, fig.width = 7}

Plot_distribution(sc_gold)

```

## Generate a new, sparse data set from reference

Cool, now that we have the reference data, we can use it to derive sparse data sets were artificial zeros are introduced. <br>
This can be done using the **introduce_sparsity** function. To control for the severety of the sparsity, the lambda parameter is used. <br>
It ranges from 0 to 1. The closer to zero, the more zeros will be introduced into the data set. In this example we use 0.01.

```{r generate_sparse_data}
sparse_data <- introduce_sparsity(0.01)
```

Again we can check for the sparsity level now in the new data set. Here, `r get_sparsity(sparse_data)` % are now included in the data set! Great! <br>
In a final step, the distribution of the new data set can be plotted, again.

```{r plot_sparse_data, , fig.width = 7}

Plot_distribution(sparse_data)
```
